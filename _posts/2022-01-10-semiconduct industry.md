What the Semiconductor Supply Chain Looks Like

Design: Semiconductor chip designs are created for specific or general device usage.
Manufacturing (Front End): Silicon wafers are processed through an extensive series of manufacturing steps then diced into multiple chips (also called dies or devices).
Manufacturing (Back End): Chips are layered and assembled into packages that can be mounted onto circuit boards. Packaged chips are then tested under different electrical and temperature conditions.
End Product Integration: Chips are integrated by electronics and equipment manufacturers to create end products for consumers.
Consumption: End products are shipped to companies, retailer, and consumers worldwide.

Different Types of Companies in Semiconductor Manufacturing

Fabless semiconductor companies and electronics manufacturers (and independent design companies) create the design and specifications required for their chips.
Foundries are contracted to manufacture the designed chips.
OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly & test) companies assemble, package, and test the chips for consumption. ASE Global is the market leader in assembly and testing services, capturing 30% of the global OSAT market in 2021.
OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and contracted EMS (electronics manufacturing service) companies integrate the packaged chip into devices. ASE Global is also a leading EMS provider, and over the course of the company’s history, has helped manufacture more than three trillion chips.
Devices are then sold by the fabless companies and electronics manufacturers at the start of the chain.
IDMs (integrated device manufacturers) that design, manufacture and sell their own chips.
