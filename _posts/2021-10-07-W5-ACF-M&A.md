# Paper discussion

- ## What is the motivation of the acquisition the paper suggests?
  - Inefficient market, rational managers, arbitrage.
  - 
  - We propose a theory of acquisitions related to the neoclassical theory, but also
able to accommodate the additional evidence. In this theory, transactions are driven
by stock market valuations of the merging firms.

- ##  What does the model trying to explain?
  - Participants, the payments
  - 
  - Model helps explain who acquires whom, the choice of the medium of
payment, the valuation consequences of mergers, and merger waves.

- ## What are the empirical predictions of the model? Short run? Long run?
  - ![](2021-10-11-16-41-29.png)
    - short term 1,2,3
    - Long term 5,6,7
