## Sugar Futures as an Investment Alternative During Market Turmoil: Case Study of 2008 and 2020 Market Drop 

 

- Gold revealed negative correlation during the outbreak of the pandemic

- Oil did not provide desired diversification effects during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it performed well during the market turmoil caused by the financial crisis in 2008.

- During the financial crisis in 2008 when stocks fell, agricultural commodities offered a short-term alternative. (Bohl et al. [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-020-00903-1#ref-CR5))

- Stock prices started to decrease in November 2007, followed by agricultural commodities in July 2008. However, they generally remained well above the pre-2008 levels (Maitah and Smutka [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-020-00903-1#ref-CR31))

- Tropical commodities including tea, cocoa, coffee, sugar and cotton bucked this trend.

- Sugar is linked to crude oil due to ethanol production (Lima et al. [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-020-00903-1#ref-CR29); Dias et al. [2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-020-00903-1#ref-CR12)).

- Sugar has served as a hedge against falling equity markets during the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007, while it did not serve as a hedge against losses caused by the coronavirus in 2020. In both cases, no statistically significant influence has been exerted from equity prices to sugar prices.

- Tremendously dropping oil prices, having statistically significant influences on the prices of sugar made prices of sugar drop alike oil. 

- The overall sugar market and its dynamics are, however, influenced not only by market fundamentals, but also by regulations. 

- A major benefit of trading sugar futures instead of oil futures is posed by the lower contract size.
